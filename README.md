Planning a trip to Hawaii? I've researched temperature and precipitation data. 

## Climate Analysis and Exploration

### Climate App
Designed a Flask API for static and dynamic queries to return Hawaii weather data. 

### Additional Temperature Analysis
Compared temperatures in June and December and ran a t-test. 
Selected a date range for a trip and determined average, max, and min temps.
